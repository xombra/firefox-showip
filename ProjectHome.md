Display information regarding the IPv4s and IPv6s about the current site in the status bar.

ShowIP is a Mozilla Firefox extension which shows the IP Address of the current page in the browser's status bar and allows queries to different databases about it when you right click on it. The IP is colored red for an IPv4 address and green for an IPv6 address (hence the name). Since v0.7.8 these colors can be changed in the preferences menu. With a left click one can get information about the hostname of the current page. These queries are fully customizable in the settings dialog. You can also run custom local programs.
